I hope you are doing well.

My name is Sheikh Altamash, and I am in my final year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Anjuman College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur.

I am seeking a full-time role or internship in software development. Recently, I completed a 3-month internship as a Full Stack Developer, contributing to a production-level e-commerce application.

My skills include the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), REST APIs, Firebase, Next.js, and NestJS. I have led hackathon teams and built scalable applications.

I would appreciate it if you could inform me of any relevant openings or refer me to someone in your network.

My resume is attached for your reference. I am happy to provide any additional information if needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Letâ€™s build something impactful together.

Warm regards,
